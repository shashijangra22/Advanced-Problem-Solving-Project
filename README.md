# Technologies to be used

| Title  | Details |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Languages  | C, C++, Python, Markdown  |
| Tools  | Sublime Text, Git  |

# Deliverables

The project delivers the following functionalities as an api to the user : 

| Function  | Syntax | Parameters | Description | Complexity |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Create Heap | create() | None | returns root pointer of newly created heap | O(1) |
| Insert | H.insert(x) | key to insert | insert a key x to heap | O(log(n)) |
| Get Minimum  | H.getMin() | None | returns minimum element in the heap | O(1) |
| Delete  | H.delete(x) | key to delete | deletes the key x in the heap | O(log(n)) |
| Extract Minimum  | H.extractMin()  | None | deletes minimum element in the heap | O(log(n)) |
| Decrease Key  | H.decreaseKey(x,y) | key to be modified, new value to update | decreases the key x by value y | O(log(n)) |
| Merge  | H.merge(X) | heap root pointer to merge with | merges the 2 heaps H and X | O(log(n)) |

Along with above mentioned functionalities,this projects aims to provide comparative analysis on below major operations with that of AVL tree:-
  - Insertion
  - Deletion
  - Search

Also, we have implemented Prim's Algorithm using Binomial heap.The basic method to finding a Minimum Spanning Tree is based on a greed approach. From a particular vertex ,the next vertex is so chosen so that it can be connected to the current tree
using the edge of the lowest weight. Repeating this process until all the nodes are included yields the Minimum Spanning Tree. The Prim’s Algorithm is based on the above approach. It uses a Heap for finding the next vertex with the minimum edge weight which can be included in the Minimum spanning tree.


# Project delivery plan

We aim to deliver the project as a menu driven program which allows user to build a binary heap with all the standard heap functions and a merge function which works in O(log n) time.
Along with that  compare its performance with AVL and 

# End User Documentation

## Binomial heap functionalities:- 

  - go to directory of project and simply run g++ binomialheap.cpp command through terminal.
  - The corresponding .out will be generated. Execute this file using the command ./a.out .
  - A menu will be prompted requesting for the operation to be performed.
      - Press 1 to insert and then provide the value to be inserted in the binomial heap.
      - Press 2 to extract min:- returns the minimum value present in the the binomial heap. 
      - Press 3 to decrease key:- Terminal will prompt for old key. Provide the old key following with the new key(It should be smaller than the old key).Old key will be replaced with the new key(smaller value). If the new value is greater than the old value, then the program will show the error message.
      - Press 4 to delete a value from the binomial heap and then provide the value to be deleted.
      - Press 5 to quit from the menu driven program.
      - Press 6 to print the binomial heap.
  - The terminal will prompt for filename:-
    There are three input files:-
      - random.txt - contains around 20.000 random numbers.
      - sorted.txt - contains numbers 1-20,00,000 in increasing order.
      - reverse.txt - contains numbers 1-20,00,000 in descending order .
    Provide the filename accordingly.
  - The terminal will prompt for the numbers of values to be inserted from the file(Maximum value can be 20,00,000).
  - The program will create a binomial heap which contains the number of values that are selected in prior step and data will be from the file that was selected earlier.
  


# Plan for testing
An input file of a specified format can be supplied as an input to the program which includes test cases that encounters the best, avg. and worst time complexity of Binomial heap functions.
